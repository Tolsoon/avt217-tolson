        <h5>After his Washington Wizards overcame fatigue and overwhelmed the Cleveland Cavaliers for a 124-112 win Thursday, the second night of a back-to-back set, the coach spoke passionately about Bradley Beal’s standing among the NBA’s all-stars. Brooks heaped about 40 seconds of adoration on Beal, who had just produced his ninth game of the season with at least 35 points and five assists, before stopping himself.

“I know I’m defending him now," Brooks said, “and I don’t know why because I know he’s an all-star."

Beal appears likely to be among the chosen when the reserves are announced Thursday, but would his third straight all-star appearance be his most deserving? </h5>

          CHICAGO — Trae Young knows he has haters.

The first-time NBA All-Star is just paying more attention to the respect he's receiving instead.

"The critics, that's gonna come," Young said. "I still had a lot of votes from fans to get to this game. I know there's gonna be a lot of people who have doubt, but there are people out there pulling for me."

Young, 21, is averaging 29.7 points and 9.2 assists for the Atlanta Hawks in his second year. He finished with 2,829,969 fan votes — first among Eastern Conference guards —  to secure a place as a starter on Team Giannis' squad in Sunday's game. Yet had he not won that slot, it's unclear if Young would have garnered an All-Star selection as one of the 14 reserves selected by the 30 NBA coaches.
